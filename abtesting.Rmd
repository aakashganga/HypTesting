### 1.6 Hypothesis Testing
The null hypothesis states that the difference between the control and experiment is due to chance. 
If pcont and ptest are the control and test probabilities, then according to the null hypothesis
H0:pexp???pcont=0

The alternate hypothesis is that
H1:pexp???pcont???0


Example

# Control Group:
# 974 clicks with 10,072 page views

# test group:
# 1242 clicks with 9886 page views

# Success criteria = minimum 2 % change in click through rate

# Question: Can we launch the experimental change?

Approach 1: Assume simple random sampling
#![Here is a defintion](pooled.png)

```{r}
Ncont = 10072
Xcont = 974

Nexp = 9886
Xexp = 1242

Ppool = (Xcont+Xexp)/(Ncont+Nexp)
 
SEpool = sqrt(Ppool*(1-Ppool)*(1/Ncont + 1/Nexp))


Pexp = Xexp/Nexp

Pcont = Xcont/Ncont

dhat = Pexp - Pcont

dhat
```

Now calculate Confidence Interval around dhat


```{r}
# Formula for CI = zVal*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)

alpha=0.05
ci = 1-alpha

zVal <- round(qnorm(1 - (1 - ci)/2), 4) # divided by 2 for 2-sided test

(zVal)

int = zVal*SEpool


# Thus confidence interval is 
c(dhat-int, dhat+int)
```

Given that the confidence interval doesn't contain zero and lower bound of CI > 2%, we can definitely launch the change.


Approach 2: Apply a proportion test

2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction (z-test)

```{r}
prop.test(c(1242,974),c(9886,10072),correct=FALSE)
```


Approach 3: Apply non-parametric test (chi-sq test)
```{r}
M <- as.table(rbind(c(974, 10072), c(1242, 9886)))
dimnames(M) <- list(group = c("Control", "Experiment"),
                    Measure = c("Clicks","Impressions"))
(Xsq <- chisq.test(M,correct = FALSE))  # Prints test summary
```
